# Image-Classifier-and-Feature-Extractor
Images were fed into pre-trained models like the Resnet-50 and feautre extraction was done. Features were then fed into a SVM/Decision tree and trained. Images were then classified after feature extraction using the predictions of SVM/Decision tree. Mxnet framework was used with classification done using Scikit Learn library and Numpy, scripted in python.
